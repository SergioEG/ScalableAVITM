Autoencoding Variational Inference for Topic Model (AVITM) is an AEVB based inference method for LDA proposed by Akash Srivastava and Charles Sutton. In this repository we develop a model that tries to make the AVITM scalable by using Document Embeddings as input for the inference Networks. The results are very promising, obtaining very coherent topics while training a much smaller number of parameters in the Inference Networks.

This work is the result of my Master's Thesis.
